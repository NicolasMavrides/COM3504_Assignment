----------
- Search for events by dates, keywords and location -- a form page with fields in the front end, DB queries in the backend
  -> When searching by name and dates, show events in a list 
  -> When searching by location, show events in a map -- most probably on a seperate page
- Creation of events via a "create post" page. would include text, photos, address, author information etc.
- When a photo selfie is taken, user should be able to either create event or select existing event from list -- so a page with existing events required, possibly the Home Page?
- Webworkers required for working offline; take a selfie and create a draft which would cache locally until connection is back online, then data would update to the website.
